# What is AIT?

* AIT is AI Test Package of testbed `qunomon`.

* AIT is built in as a docker container.

* In addition to the pre-installed AITs, you can implement a new one yourself.

* The pre-installed AITs are as follows

  * eval_coverage_ca_pairwise  
    Evaluate the coverage of context attributes.

  * eval_ca_distribution  
    Evaluate the distribution of context attributes.

  * eval_mnist_data_coverage  
    Evaluate mnist data coverage.

  * eval_mnist_bw_classify  
    Evaluate mnist data black/white classification.

  * eval_mnist_acc_tf2.3  
    Evaluate mnist accuracy for tensorflow-2.3.

  * eval_bdd100k_aicc_tf2.3  
    Evaluate bdd100k accuracy for tensorflow-2.3.

  * eval_regression_analyze_coefficient_determination_tf2.3  
    Evaluate regression analyze coefficient determination for tensorflow-2.3.

  * eval_regression_analyze_rmse_and_mae_tf2.3  
    Evaluate regression analyze rmse and mae for tensorflow-2.3.

  * eval_dnn_coverage_tf1.13  
    Evaluate mnist dnn coverage for tensorflow-1.13.

  * eval_metamorphic_test_tf1.13  
    Evaluate mnist metamorphic test for tensorflow-1.13.

  * eval_adversarial_example_acc_test_tf2.3  
    Evaluate mnist adversarial example accuracy for tensorflow-2.3.
